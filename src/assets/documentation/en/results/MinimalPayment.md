## Remaining monthly bill

### Why do I still have an electricity bill?
PLN requires you to buy a _minimal amount_ of electricity that depends on the size of your connection.
You will need to buy this electricity, whether you use it or not.

It is _not profitable_ to produce more electricity than the minimal amount you have to buy from PLN.
This limits the amount of panels it is financially viable to install.
