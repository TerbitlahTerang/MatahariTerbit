## Recommended number of panels

The recommended number of panels is currently limited by the _size_ of your electricity connection.

### Connection size

PLN does not allow you to install more panels than the size of your electricity connection. For example,
when you have a 2.200 VA (Watt) connection, you can install a solar system with up to 2.200 Wp capacity, or
around 5 panels at most.

👉 Your monthly electricity consumption seems to be on the high side for the size of your
connection. You might want to request a larger connection from PLN.
