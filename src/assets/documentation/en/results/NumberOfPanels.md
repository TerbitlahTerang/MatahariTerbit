## Recommended number of panels

This recommendation is based on the following three factors.

### 1 Electricity bill
It is not profitable to produce more electricity than you use.
The national utility company (PLN) cannot pay you any money.
Therefore, the best you can do is to reduce your monthly bill to be as small possible.

### 2 Connection size

You are not allowed to install more panels than the size of your electricity connection. For example,
when you have a 2.200 VA (Watt) connection, you can install a solar system with up to 2.200 Wp capacity, or
around 5 panels at most.

### 3 Location of your house
How often the sun shines in your part of the country, affects the amount of electricity your panels
will produce. The more sun, the fewer panels you need.
